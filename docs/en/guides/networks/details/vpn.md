# VPN

To securely access a private network, users can establish a virtual tunnel via L2TP VPN. Once connected, they can securely communicate with the instances connected to their network. To enable this, activating the VPN option on the panel will automatically provide the user with a username, password, and a pre-shared key, which they can use to create an L2TP tunnel.
